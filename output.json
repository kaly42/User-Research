We of course also love advent calendars and my kids always look forward to what their calendars will be each year. I thought this one would be great for them to share and we could all work on it together.I love that the puzzle is broken down into individual boxes for each day. Each box contains 21 pieces. I feel that this is perfect for a child and is a manageable and fun amount to put together each day....working towards completing the whole puzzle.The packaging is very nice and seems sturdy with the possibility of it being able to be used for years to come. I would definitely think a child would need help opening each box as they could be ripped or torn more easily by a child. The puzzle pieces for the most part are nice. Some bent and peeling a bit in a few spots. I think it has good value is priced will especially for the reusable factor. The picture is festive but like others have said the elves are a little strange looking.Overall, love this idea for an advent calendar.", "title": "Great advent calendar option for the whole family", "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "My husband and I work on an Army base, so when I saw this Army-themed advent calendar, I had to get it! I'm pretty excited about it and my husband thinks it's cool and he's looking forward to opening it on December 1st!I would like to open it and pop open all the days and put the toys together, but we have to be patient. Based on what the box displays, this is going to be the talk of the office and a favorite of everyone's! I am already recommending other coworkers and friends to buy this for their offices. For now I want to give it 5 stars, and I'll update my review once December comes around and we start opening it up!", "title": "Such A Cool Advent Calendar", "rating": "5.0"},
{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "Perfect for boys and counting down the days until Christmas. Better than candy and something a boy will actually play with. I can\u2019t wait to see my son open these up daily and build up a big scene and then play with them. They are the cheaper kind of toys you\u2019d find at the dollar store or something but it\u2019s still fun. Great idea", "title": "Something different for the Christmas countdown", "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "This advent calendar has an illustration of a military base on the inside cover that can be used as a play base for the enclosed calendar pieces.They also have an additional, removable, play base that has desert scenes, greenery scenes, and water scenes, depicting Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines (I\u2019m assuming), as well as a medic tent, training fields, barracks, etc.All you need to add is a child\u2019s imagination.

{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "I got my kids some advent calendars and I have to admit, they look so cool now that I had to get one for myself as well. So I came across this one and the soldier toys were something I enjoyed as a kid. This one reminds me of those toys so much that I just had to have it. The price is perfect and the toys inside look like they will be awesome. I cant wait for December to start so I can have fun as well opening up the days.

{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "I was intrigued by this Advent idea, since my family does like to do puzzles together. The large box opens regular puzzle style instead of just the lid folding back. It comes with 24 smaller numbered boxes, a poster of what the finished puzzle will look like, and a card to assemble and move each day\u2019s pieces. The puzzle picture itself is ok; Santa, the tree, and presents look pretty good, but the Elves are a bit \u201coff looking\u201d. I like that each day\u2019s pieces are numbered on the back, so you will be able to easily divide the pieces back up for reuse. Several of the pieces in the first box are already creased or are pealing apart. Not a huge issue as I don\u2019t plan on gluing this puzzle together and displaying it long term. I am looking for a family activity, but I am hoping to be able to use it more than one year. I am crossing my fingers that the pieces and numbered boxes will hold up for a couple of years.", "title": "If you are careful with it, you can probably use it for a few years", "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "You get a box with 24 numbered boxes, along with a poster of what I think the puzzle is supposed to look like, and a thick piece of paper that says you can put together 1/24th of the puzzle on and then move it to the rest of the puzzle.  The puzzle pieces are numbered so you can rebox them and reuse them year after year.I opened the first box and tried to put it together.  Since I got the thick paper which says I can do 1/24th of the puzzle on that I thought that each box was a complete 1/24th section of the puzzle, however, as you can see in the picture, this doesn't seem to be true.  I found the edge pieces and got those together as much as I could, but I am missing some.  I don't quite see the reason for there not being a complete section of the puzzle in a day's box.Also, a couple of pieces came bent.  I don't know if you can see it in the picture but the first puzzle piece of the second border section is bent on the first bottom part (just where the light brown/orange changes to brown).  You can also see it on the first separate piece on the bottom lower right (also the 4th piece on the bottom you can see the top part is bent).  I'm not sure if the puzzle has been put together before or if when the puzzle was originally made and taken apart it was bent.For those two issues, I have removed a star.  It looks like it could be fun, but it also looks like it could be just a little bit better.", "title": "Looks like it could be fun", "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "I have seen these advent puzzles in the past and have always been intrigued by them. The concept is a unique take on the advent calendar idea. The box has 24 individual boxes for each day that allows you to put together a small section throughout December, counting down the days until Christmas. The small sections would make it easy to work the puzzle with small children and make it a family activity. The pieces fit together well but you can fit together the wrong pieces without realizing it so be aware of that. The image is not the highest quality but this should not deter you from starting one of these puzzles for your Christmas countdown. The puzzle is well marked on the back so that after the holiday count down is over, you can break the puzzle apart and return then to their individual boxes until next year. Or if you choose, it would be a great way to pass the tradition along to friends or family.Pros: Fun way to countdown holiday season  Easily to work small sections as family activity  Easy to breakdown for next yearCons: Image is not high quality  Can put together wrong pieces", "title": "Fun idea, repeatable next year but picture is not the best quality", "rating": "4.0"},
{"asin": "B0C5DMKKHX", "text": "My son has recently developed a liking to military toys, thanks to his military-obsessed bestie. When I saw this military themed advent calendar, I knew this would be perfect for them, so I got one for each of the kiddos. The quality of the toys is decent, especially given the current listing price of $18 ($20 with 20% off coupon), but don\u2019t expect them to be \u201calloy material\u201d as one of the product images say. They are in fact plastic, as the product descriptions indicate. The wheels roll fine and the details on the vehicles are good. I especially like that it comes with a play mat so kids can build a base with the included signs and tree props. You\u2019ll want to get military figures separately as they don\u2019t come with this calendar. Overall a nice starter or supplemental set for the military loving kid in your life.", "title": "Perfect for the military toy enthusiasts", "rating": "4.0"}
