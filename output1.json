I was contemplating whether to take this and pay extra shipping or whether to take a pack of 6 for no shipping from another seller. I decided to buy this and pay for extra shipping because i thought its worth the money as i was getting 3 for the extra shipping cost.Turns out, there is only 1 toothbrush in the order. Seller did not accept the mistake - though the picture clearly shows 3 toothbrushes. As a result, i had to order another toothbrush and pay the shipping again.", "title": "Just one toothbrush", "rating": "2.0"},
{"asin": "B00LO33MBG", "text": "I bought this product because I thought it was a 3 pack and was really disappointed when there was only one toothbrush when the package was delivered. I needed more than one because two of my kids are travelling.  I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased. The picture really needs to be changed, very misleading!", "title": "ONLY ONE TOOTHBRUSH, NOT THREE", "rating": "3.0"},
